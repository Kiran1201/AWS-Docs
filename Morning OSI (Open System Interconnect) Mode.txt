OSI (Open System Interconnect) Model 
------------------------------------------

It is a reference model not an implemented model. 


We Have 7 Layers of OSI 
---------------------------

1. Application Layer  ( Layer 7 )
2. Presentation Layer ( Layer 6 )
3. Session Layer   ( Layer 5 )
4. Transport Layer ( Layer 4 )
5. Network Layer   ( Layer 3 )
6. Data Link Layer ( Layer 2 )
7. Physical Layer  ( Layer 1 )

**NOTE:- The Layers are written in the order of Sender to receiver . 

-----------------------------
1. Application Layer :- We interact with the application and provide data . Eg:- http,https,ftp etc.

2. Presentation Layer :- It is going to compress the data as well as encrypt the data for security. 

3. Session Layer :- It helps to maintain the connection with the server . It also is responsible to develop and maintain checkpoints while downloading data from the network. It is done with the help of cookies. 

4. Transport Layer :- To Perform End to End Communication we use Transport Layer . It is going to use port numbers in order to get end to end communication.

		FTP --> 20,21
                ssh ----> 22
		Telnet ---> 23
		SMTP --> 25
		DNS --> 53
		DHCP --> 67,68
		http --> 80
		NetBIOS --> 135,139
            	https --> 443
		SMB --> 445
		MySQL --> 3306
		RDP --> 3389 

5. Network Layer :- Here the Logical Address ( IP Address ) is used . All the routing activities will also take place here.

6. Data Link Layer :- It's Responsibility is to ensure the data corruption does not take place. It will be done with the help of CRC ( Cyclic Redundancy Check) check .

7. Physical Layer :- All the Networking wires are involved here.
