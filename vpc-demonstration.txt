#**VPC practical (Imp) (virtual)
   # Intro :-
      1. it is virtualized , isolated.
      2. aws s3, dynamo not used VPC , but all services are used vpc
      3. secure network on cloud by working on amazon vpc.
      4. VPC also known as logical data center
      5. every region contain default VPC
      6. whenever we create vpc , automatically 2 things created
         1. NACL --> network acess control list
         2. Main route table: in main route in route option Ip shown and also target show loca

    # Create VPC :-
      step 1: go to services --> choose networking ---> choose vpc 
      step 2: click on your VPCs or click on create vpc
      step 3: for now we choose VPC only
      step 4: enter any name
      step 5: choose ipv4 CIDR manual input if you know ip address otherwise choose IPAM- allocated IPV4 CIDR block
      step 6: enter ip address
      step 7: choose ipv6 if required
      step 8: choose default tanancy 
              Note: default tenency is shared.
                    dedicated tenency menas hardware specific for you. it is expensive and not cover in free tier.
      step 9: click on create
    
    # to verify NACL, Main route table
      step 1: left hand side in VPC (virtual private cloud) option, click on Route tables
      step 2: if There is 2 Route table, 1 for default and 2nd for your created VPC
      step 3: select route table and in details option if VPC show as default means this main route table for default
      step 4: select route table and in details option if VPC not show as means this main route table for your VPC
      step 5: if there is created main route table for your VPC, means they verify vpc created successfully.
      step 6: left hand side go to security option, select Network ACLs
      step 7: similary there is 1 default NACL and other for our created VPC
      step 8: select NACL and in details option if in VPC ID there is default shown means this is for default VPC
      step 9: select NACL and in details option if in VPC ID there is not default shown means this is for our VPC
  
    # subnets
      to secure network we create 2 (any numbers of subnet we can created) networks
      1. public network: access on internet. access by anyone
      2. private network: access not on internet.

      **Note: whenever we create subnet, it's automatic connected to main route table

    # to create subnets
      step 1: left hand side in VPC (virtual private cloud) option, click on subnets
      step 2: click on create subnet
      step 3: choose vpc ip
      step 4: enter subnet name (like public)
      step 5: if you want choose AZ 
      step 6: enter Ipv4 subnet ip  (for example 10.0.2.0/24, choose any reporting values from CIDR (ip addressing)) 
      step 7: enter tag if you want
      step 8: follow step 4 to step 7 again to create other subnet for same vpc 
      step 9: click on create

   # to verify, whenever we create subnet, it's automatic connected to main route table
     step 1: left hand side in VPC (virtual private cloud) option, click on Route tables
     step 2: select vpc main route table
     step 3: go to subnet associations  option
     step 4: In Subnets without explicit associations option, you can see subnet name and ip and any more things
     step 5: if you can see your subnet details in vpc main route table, means succesffully 
   
   **router responsibility to give direction and if there is not correct path so its responsed. 

   # create public and private route table
     step 1: left hand side in VPC (virtual private cloud) option, click on Route tables
     step 2: click on create route table
     step 3: enter route name, select VPC and click on create
     step 4: follow all steps again to create private route

   # connect public subnet to public route table: it automatically disconnected from main route table
     step 1: left hand side in VPC (virtual private cloud) option, click on Route tables
     step 2: select public route
     step 3: click on subnet assosiation
     step 4: click on edit subnet assosiation
     step 5: add public subnet

   ** Note: to allow internet on public subnet we used gateway. internet gateway is always connect with VPC. expensive service. paid.
   ** 1 internet gateway = 1 VPC
   
    # to create a internet gateway
      step 1: left hand side in VPC (virtual private cloud) option, click on internet gateway
      step 2: click on create a gateway
      step 3: enter name of IG
      step 4: add tag if you want
      step 5: click on create
      step 6: after successfully creation check status --> ditached
      step 7: to attach with VPC, select internet gateway and click on action
      step 8: click on attach and add VPC
      step 9: select internet ip: 0.0.0.0/0 (anywhere)
    
    # to connect public route and VPC 
      step 1: left hand side in VPC (virtual private cloud) option, click on Route tables
      step 2: select public route
      step 3: go to route option --> click on edit
      step 4: click on add route
      step 5: add ip 0.0.0.0/0, and choose internet gateway (igw (gateway ip automatic come))
      step 6: click on save changes
   
    # optional --> to enable automatic ipv4 address
       step 1: click on subnet
       step 2: select public subnet
       step 3: click on action
       step 4: enable auto assign public ipv4 address

    ** nacl --> sbnet level firewall ----> stateless firewall ------> inbound
    ** ec2 (SG) ----> instance level firewall  ---> statefull firewall ----> outbund
    
    # to check network for created VPC
      1. for public subnet, create ec2 instance:
         step 1: follow all normal steps to create ec2 linux server
         step 2: update network setting:
                 1. choose create VPC
                 2. choose public subnet
                 3. allow ICmP - ipv4 protocol for security group
 
         **Note: command ping for ICMP protocol (internet control message protocol) --> no port number ----> layer 3 (n/w) ---> trobleshoot n/w issue
                 to connect with multiple computer we used ICMP.
                 how its work: if computer 'A' comunicate with computer 'B' so computer A send the icmp echo request and computer B wants to connect they return response.
         
         step 3: check access over the internet, open command promt
         step 4: enter command, ping public_ipv4_address
         step 5: if we get the response means everything correct
         step 6: now check on server
         step 7: connect with linux server
         step 8: enter the command, ping -c 4 google.com
                 Note: -c: if we don't write -c its give unlimited response
                        4: choose any number

       2. for private subnet, create ec2 instance:
          step 1: follow all normal steps to create ec2 linux server
          step 2: update network setting:
                 1. choose create VPC
                 2. choose private subnet
                 3. auto assign disable --> for enable there is charges
                 3. allow ICMP - ipv4 protocol for security group
          step 3: follow all steps same as public subnet, internt connection check
          step 4: but for private subnet, we did not recive response over the network 
          step 5: for internal connection to access private subnet we used internal domain network

          **Note: bastian host:- public subnet to private subnet
          **Note: for private subnet we communicate internally or on our server we can not communicate with outside over internet server
          **Note: for internal connection we create ssh connection
          
          step 6: copy the key from key_pair.pem file 
          step 7: open the linux server which connected to public subnet
          step 8: enter the command, vi key.pem --> paste key ---> save the file
          step 9: check the permission of key.pem file. enter command, ls -l
          step 10: change permission to r------, enter the command , chmod 400 key.pem
          step 11: ssh -i key.pem ec2-user@private (ip  identify for password)
      
      # now close the connection
        step 1: terminate ec2 instances
        step 2: go to subnets and delete
        step 3: go to routes and delete public route (main route automatic deleted when vpc deleted)
        step 4: delete internet gateway (first detached vpc)
        step 5: delete vpc

# task for today
  repeat practice
  create 3 public and 2 priivate and each will have two ec2 instances.
  check internet connection, internal communication
